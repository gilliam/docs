Welcome to Gilliam
==================

Gilliam is a platform for hosting what is called *12 factor* apps.  It
aims to make the live easier for developers and operators of
distributed systems.  It also helps you with continious deployment.

Gilliam does this by providing isolated environments where your apps
run, a simple build sever that packages your apps into artifacts that
can quickly be deployed and an orchestrator that makes sure your apps
keep running in the case of failure.
This is the documentation for Gilliam, a simple app hosting platform.
